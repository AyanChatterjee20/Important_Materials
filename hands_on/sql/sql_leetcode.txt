Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places.
In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players. 


create table players (
player_id int,
device_id int, 
event_date date,
games_palyed int
);


insert into players values 
(1,2,'2016-03-01',5),
(1,2,'2016-03-02',6),
(2,3,'2017-06-25',1),
(3,1,'2016-03-02',0),
(3,4,'2018-07-03',5);

select player_id, lead() over(partition by player_id order by event_date) lead_day, lag() over(partition by player_id order by event_date) lag_day from players;
